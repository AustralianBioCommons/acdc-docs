## General Information 
Access to the data files in the ACvA Precision Medicine Platform is strictly controlled.

Respect for, and protection of the interests of research participants are fundamental to the stewardship of human genomic, other ‘omic’ and associated phenotypic data. The [National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) - updated 2018](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018) (developed by NHMRC, ARC, and Universities Australia) sets the expectation that the informed consent under which data or samples were collected is the basis for determining the appropriateness of sharing data, including through systems such as the ACvA Precision Medicine Platform.

As such applications must be made to access data files, and these will be considered by the relevant data access committee.

## Data Access Process

Data access is given according to the terms in the Data Access Policy (link when finalised).

Data access is granted on a case-by-case basis and the final decision is made by the data custodians of each study.

The following information must be provided in order for an application to be assessed:
* requirement 1
* requirement 2
* requirement 3

Data access applications will be processed within 6 weeks from the date of a complete application being submitted.
