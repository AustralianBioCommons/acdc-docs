The data dictionary browser presents the metadata model that is used to structure the metadata in the system. 

It is accessed by clicking the 'Data Dictionary' button in the top right corner or by going to: [https://data.acdc.ozheart.org/DD](https://data.acdc.ozheart.org/DD)

The dictionary can be displayed in a table view or graph view by clicking on the desired layout type in the top left. 

## Graph View

The graph view gives an overall view of the graph structure of the data dictionary. 

Properties from each object in the graph can be investigated by clicking the object, then clicking 'Open properties'.

Clicking the 'Close X' button in the top right or the 'close properties' button in the left side bar returns the user back to the graph view.s

## Table View

The 'Table View' displays each object in the data dictionary, grouped by their categories. 

Clicking on any of the objects expands the table to show the properties for each object, their type, whether they are required and a short description.


## Searching

Fields in the dictionary can be searched using the search box in the sidebar to the left. This will display fields or descriptions that match the words entered in the box. 

The matched fields appear in a drop-down of fields that can be selected in order to find out more information about that field and which object it belongs to in the data dictionary graph.
